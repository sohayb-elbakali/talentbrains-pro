# Supabase Configuration

This directory contains the Supabase configuration for the project.

## Local Development

To run the project locally, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=""
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=""
```

You can get these values from your Supabase project's API settings.
